# Rough Sketch-Simplification using Deep Learning

This is a PyTorch implementation of the the Paper by Simo-Sera et.al. on Cleaning Rough Sketches using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks.

I even wrote a [blog article on medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/simplifying-rough-sketches-using-deep-learning-c404459622b9) explaining the complete paper.

- PyTorch
- PIL

- numpy
- pandas

## Noteable Issues with the Implementation

The major problem is with the availability of the proper dataset used by the authors. Hence, the reproducibilty issues.<br>
And availability of a GPU too. I don't have one.
